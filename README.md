🚀 Project Update! 🍎📷

Excited to announce our progress on Task-05: developing a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, empowering users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices. 🥗✨

Objective: Create a model that identifies food items from images and estimates their calorie content.

Steps:

Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset of food images along with their calorie information.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the images.
Model Development: Implement an advanced model to recognize various food items and estimate their calorie content.
Model Training: Train the model using state-of-the-art techniques to improve accuracy and reliability.
Model Evaluation: Test the model’s performance and fine-tune it for optimal results.
Deployment: Integrate the model into a user-friendly application for dietary tracking and informed food choices.
Looking forward to seeing how this technology can assist in healthier living! 🌟
